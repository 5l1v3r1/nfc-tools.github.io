## Presentation

This product is made by [Advanced Card Systems Limited](http://www.acs.com.hk/) and seems to be available in different layouts but hardware doesn't differ so much.

They are all using a [PN532 NFC Controller chip](/resources/chips/pn53x/) and a ST7 microcontroler unit.

I've made some pictures of the designs I have seen in the wild, but there are probably more.

Feel free to send pictures of different designs you stumble on.

The current release of libnfc supports all firmware versions.

### Important note

libnfc needs "CCID Exchange command" from PCSC-lite to work, plus PCSC-lite denies bogus firmware: >= 2.0 and < 2.07. You will need to configure PCSC in order to libnfc work correctly (please see Troubleshooting section in [README](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc/blob/master/README) file)

## Touchatag

The ACR122 reader was also used in the touchatag project (formerly tikitag).

Unlike many other devices, you could order it from the e-store. A $39.95 starter package contained:

* 1 ACR122 Reader;
* 10 stickers MIFARE Ultralight tags. 

### Important notes

* These tags have a pre-defined read-only content which is almost but not fully compiliant to NFC Forum Type 2 Tag specifications;
* Even Touchatag is the simpliest device to obtain, this device have a poor support for emulation and P2P under libnfc. 

## ACR122-like working devices

At the moment, it seems libnfc can talk with all ACR122, please report success or failure.

The following versions were reported to work:

* ACR122U101: ACS ACR122 v1.01,
* ACR122U102: Tikitag v1.02,
* ACR122U102: Touchatag,
* ACR122U203: ACS ACR122 v2.03, PICC

On this picture, you can see PN532 chip (red circle) and a 8-bit MCU (the biggest chip).

This touchatag contains:

* NFC chip: PN532/104 model (no public datasheet available);
* MCU: [ST7SCR1E4M1](http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/DATASHEET/CD00003037.pdf) 8-bit low-power, full-speed USB MCU with 16Kbytes Flash, 768 bytes RAM, smartcard interface and timer .
