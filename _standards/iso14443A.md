Also known as *NFCA*.

Based on [ISO14443](../iso14443/) standards.

Near Field Communication devices implement native support for ISO14443-A tags. The [NFC Forum](http://members.nfc-forum.org/specs/spec_list/) refers to these tags as Type 1, Type 2 and Type 4 tags. **FIXME integrate this** The Anti-Collision example describes the initialization messages used to set up a communication channel and to retrieve the identifier and supported features from a tag. During the anti-collision phase, three or four different frames are received from a tag (ATQA, UID, SAK and optional ATS).

The *ATQA*, *SAK* and *ATS* values can be used to identify the manufacturer, tag type and application. However, it's not recommended to rely on *ATQA* due to potential collision when more than one target are in the field.

A recommended document to identify MIFARE tags: [MIFARE Type Identification Procedure](http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN10833.pdf).

The following table shows a list of known tags and their anti-collision values (hexadecimal). Please [contact us](/contact/) to help update and expand this list.

## ISO 14443A-4

Protocol for smartcards is referred as T=CL and is basically the same as for T=1 (for contact smartcards).
