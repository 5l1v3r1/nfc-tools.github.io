## NFC Forum Type 4 Tag 1.0

Old specification for NFC Forum Type 4 Tag allowed to use DESFire but newer version of the specification needs to use [MIFARE DESFire EV1](/resources/rfid-tags/mifare-desfire-ev1/). Most NFC-compliant devices recognize MIFARE DESFire -based Tags but support cannot be guarantee for all NFC devices.
