## E-mail

**We do not offer support by e-mail.  If you are requesting assistance, please consult the [support](/support/) page.**

You can reach us to send feedback, update this website (you can also send us pull-requests via GitHub directly, which will be faster) or ask for a shipping address if you build NFC devices and you would like us to test them or add support for them in libnfc.
